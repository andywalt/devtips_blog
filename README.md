# README

Welcome to my blog and first ever Ruby on Rails application!

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version 2.2.3p173
* Rails version 5.0.1

* System dependencies - No idea what this means!

* Configuration - Better than the Death Star.

* Database creation - Read Genesis 1-3

* Database initialization - No idea.

* How to run the test suite - I wish I had a suite.

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.) - I'm good at naps.

* Deployment instructions - FIRE THE MISSILES!

* ... !!!

Ok the end.
